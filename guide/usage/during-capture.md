# What Happens During A Capture Session

## The Banner

During a capture session, a banner will appear and state, "Webrecorder ArchiveWeb.page started debugging this browser". This banner should be present at all times during your web archiving process. No banner means the archiveweb.page extension is not capturing.

## The Color Cues
Another way to ensure that the archiveweb.page is actively capturing your webpage is checking on the extension's status. You should notice that the icon now how a green light (or yellow light).

* Green will say "Idle, Continue Browsing" which means "Ready to go! Continue archiving"
* Yellow will say "# URLs pending, please wait before loading a new page" which means "Currently debugging and capturing the assets on this specific page. Give me a moment to capture everything please"

## Instant Replay

You can instantly view what the archived page looks like, without stopping the capture session, by clicking **View Recorded Page**. This will open the page replay in a new tab so you can view the replay as the page is being archived. The **Browse Archive** link will open the current web archive collection that is being recorded into, also in a new tab.

These options will also be available after the archiving has been stopped.
