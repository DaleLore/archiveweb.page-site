# How To Terminate A Capture Session
## Choose an option:
* [Terminate from the banner](#terminate_banner)
* [Terminate from the extension](#terminate_extension)



### <a id="terminate_banner">Terminate from the banner</a>
You can terminate your session by clicking on the <b>Cancel</b> button on the banner. It will stop the recording/capturing for this page.

### <a id="terminate_extension">Terminate from the extension</a>
The same way you clicked on the archiveweb.page icon extension to click the start button for the session, you can click the stop button to close a session.


1. Click on the ArchiveWeb.page Chrome extension
2. Click on STOP

*Note: the banner will still remain in Chrome, even after recording has stopped. This is by design in Chrome for security reasons*


### Next Steps -- Browse or Archive again

After recorded has stopped, the extension popup will look as follows:

The extension will maintain the stats recorded on this tab.


From here you can:

- Click on **View Recorded Page** to view the last recorded page.

- Click on **Browse Archive** to view the entire web archive collection for this session. This may be useful if you've archived multiple pages.

- Click on **Home** to view all archival collections.

- Click **START** to start archiving anew. (This will cause the page to reload).
