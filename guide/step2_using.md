# How To Use archiveweb.page

With the archiveweb.page Chrome extension, you can archive any pages as you're viewing and interacting with them in your browser.

The first step to archiving is the *capture* process, where the extension will record or capture all network traffic and store it in the browser as part of the web archive.

All captured data is organized by pages. You can further organize your archived pages into separate archive collections, view each page to make sure it is archived correctly, and delete invidual page captures that you no longer want or need.
