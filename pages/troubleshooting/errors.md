## Common Errors and Issues

### Recording YouTube
Recording YouTube can be difficult. If you encounter an issue where recording YouTube does not work, note that recording YouTube is not possible if you have the <b>'chrome youtube app'</b> installed (It's OK if it's installed. Everyone does by default).

If this is the case, go to chrome://apps. Click the YouTube app and remove it. Try capturing again.
