# What Happens During A Capture Session

## The Banner

During a capture session, a banner will appear and state, "Webrecorder ArchiveWeb.page started debugging this browser". This banner should be present at all times during your web archiving process. No banner means the archiveweb.page extension is not capturing.

## The Color Cues
Another way to ensure that the archiveweb.page is actively capturing your webpage is checking on the extension's status. You should notice that the icon now how a green light (or yellow light). 

![archiveweb.page icon with a green box. archiveweb.page icon with a yellow box.Green means continue archiving. Yellow means give me a moment.](/assets/images/step2-usage/wr-colors-meanings.png)

* Green will say "Idle, Continue Browsing" which means "Ready to go! Continue archiving"
* Yellow will say "# URLs pending, please wait before loading a new page" which means "Currently debugging and capturing the assets on this specific page. Give me a moment to capture everything please"
