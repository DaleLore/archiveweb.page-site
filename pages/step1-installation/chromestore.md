### Finding the extension in Chrome Store

The Chrome Web Store is (unsurprisingly) big and vast. The quickest way to finding the webrecorder page with the extension is to go directly to our page. <br>

This <b><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrecorder/fpeoodllldobpkbkabpblcfaogecpndd" target="_blank"> link</a></b> should take you to webrecorder's extension page on the Chrome Store.
