3. Insert the website you want to capture
4. Click <b>GO</b> to initiate capture session
5. Click on assets (videos, links, pages, etc) that you want archived. 

## INSTRUCTIONS (WITH IMAGES)

### Scenario: "I want to capture the webrecorder website"

In this scenario, I have a collection called "web archiving" that I want to capture sessions to. If I click on the collection title, it'll take me to the collection page. (The image below is a screenshot of archiveweb.page's Current Web Archives page).

The webrecorder record button is blue! If you clicked the collection title and are on the collection page, the record button is on the left of the search bar (top image). If you're on the archiveweb.page Current Web Archives page, the record button is under <b>Actions</b> (bottom image).

- Insert the website you want to capture: <br>
Archiveweb.page will prompt you to insert a website. By default, there is an example website there. You insert your website in the same place as www.example.com. Notice that it also shows us which collection you will archive to. Here we see it's going to archive to my collection - Web Archiving.
